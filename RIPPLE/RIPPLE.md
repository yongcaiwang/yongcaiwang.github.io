Overview 
</h2>
Bottom-up $k$-vertex connected component ($k$-VCC) enumeration methods, referred to as VCCE-BU, have exhibited better efficiency compared to the exact top-down $k$-VCC enumeration method (VCCE-TD). However, VCCE-BU}has been found to have surprisingly low detection accuracy, that it may detect fewer vertices in $k$-VCC than VCCE-TD. This raises the question of what causes VCCE-BU to have a low $k$-VCC enumeration quality. 

This paper investigates the reason and proposes that the local expansion should be reformulated as a Multiple vertex collaborative Expansion problem instead of the traditional Unitary Expansion (UE). A Multiple Expansion (ME) approach, which allows to expand multiple neighboring vertices jointly and collaboratively is proposed, which is proven exact in local expansion. However, the exact ME-based local expansion needs to explore large neighborhoods in each step, which is time-consuming. To address the efficiency issue, a Ring-based Multiple Expansion (RME) is proposed to conduct ME within one-hop neighbors. A maximum flow-based merging algorithm FBM is proposed for effective merging. A maximal clique and breath-first-search-based quick seeding algorithm QkVCS is proposed to generate $k$-VCC seeds efficiently.  As a result,  RIPPLE which integrates QkVCS+FBM+RME is presented as a new accurate and efficient bottom-up approach. Extensive verifications in real large-scale graph datasets demonstrate that even the single-thread RIPPLE is much more accurate and a magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art VCCE-BU method. We also demonstrate the effective speeding up to run RIPPLE in parallel.

System Architecture 
</h2>
We first use Q$k$VCS to generate a large number of seed subgraphs in the graph, and these seeds are connected by $k$ vertices. We then use the FBM algorithm and the RME algorithm for multiple rounds of iterations. FBM determines whether the two seeds can be merged into a larger $k$-vertex connected subgraph; RME tries to add more vertices to the seed subgraph. Until all seeds are no longer growing, RIPPLE outputs the results.

Contributions
</h2>



-   The inaccuracy problem of VCCE-BU is shown due to UE and neighbor-counting-based merging. We reformulate the local expansion problem as a multiple vertex collaborative expansion problem and multiple expansion algorithm (ME), which is proven exact.  We further propose a ring-based multiple expansion (RME), which is much more time-efficient.

-   We propose a Flow-Based-Merging (FBM) method for $k$-VCS merging and QkVCS, a maximal clique and BFS-based seeding algorithm to speed up the seed generation.

-   We propose RIPPLE, which conducts  RME and FBM from the distributed $k$-VCC seeds generated by QkVCS. RIPPLE is not only accurate but also efficient.
