	Abstract = {The volume of traffic generated in indoor environments is increasing exponentially, and emerging femtocell networks are being deployed to meet associated challenges. These specific in-building deployments provide an opportunity for improving the performance of indoor positioning systems. Femtocell networks can be used to support accurate and reliable location services based on received- power and fingerprint location techniques. In fingerprint positioning methods, calibration and recalibration procedures are extremely time-consuming tasks. To address this problem, we developed a novel scenario-dependent procedure that reduced calibration points. We also analyzed several indoor propagation models, evaluating their suitability to reduce the effort required for calibration as well as their applicability for the recalibration procedures necessary to update previously recorded fingerprints. Our procedure includes both a simulation and a measurement phase, and obtains important improvements in accuracy, precision, and reliability while reducing the time and effort associated with both calibration and recalibration procedures. {\copyright} 2013 Alcatel-Lucent.},

	Abstract = {In wireless networks, radio-map based locating techniques are commonly used to cope the complex fading feature of radio signal, in which a radio-map is built by calibrating received signal strength (RSS) signatures at training locations in the offline phase. However, in severe hostile environments, such as in ship cabins where severe shadowing, blocking and multi-path fading effects are posed by ubiquitous metallic architecture, even radio-map cannot capture the dynamics of RSS. In this paper, we introduced multiple feature radio-map location method for severely noisy environments. We proposed to add low variance signature into radio map. Since the low variance signatures are generally expensive to obtain, we focus on the scenario when the low variance signatures are sparse. We studied efficient construction of multi-feature radio-map in offline phase, and proposed feasible region narrowing down and particle based algorithm for online tracking. Simulation results show the remarkably performance improvement in terms of positioning accuracy and robustness against RSS noises than the traditional radio-map method.},

@inproceedings{zampella_robust_2013,
	Abstract = {Indoor positioning is usually based on individual technologies that provide estimates of the trajectory of the person, or measures the ranges or angles between the user and known positions. Each technique has its advantages and problems, and a common way to overcome the drawbacks of single-technology solutions is to fuse the information from several system, but due to their non linear measurements, there is no optimal linear solution. We propose the use of a particle filter to fuse foot mounted inertial measurements with any additional Radio Frequency (RF) measurement. The information fusion is achieved propagating the position of the particles using the relative step displacements obtained from foot mounted Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR), and updating the weights of the particles according to the RF measurements. In our experiments the inertial unit was located in the foot of the user, and the RF system consisted in a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) receiver in the waist, and an Ultra Wide band (UWB) tag in the chest, but the scheme can be used in any sensor configuration. As the UWB measurements have a significant amount of outliers due to non line of sight conditions generated by the position of the tag in the body, received reflections, etc., we propose a new outlier rejection algorithm based on the compatibility of groups of measurements. The fusion was tested evaluating the inclusion of each of the RF systems and varying the number RFID tags used. The proposed method is able to locate a person with less than 2 m of error (for 90 \% of the obtained estimations) in the studied trajectory. This particle filter scheme offers robust indoor positioning with 100 \% availability and smooth trajectory estimation thanks to the PDR and limited error due to the RF measurements.},

@article{atia_dynamic_2013,
	Abstract = {Context-awareness and Location-Based-Services are of great importance in mobile computing environments. Although fingerprinting provides accurate indoor positioning in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), difficulty of offline site surveys and the dynamic environment changes prevent it from being practically implemented and commercially adopted. This paper introduces a novel client/server-based system that dynamically estimates and continuously calibrates a fine radio map for indoor positioning without extra network hardware or prior knowledge about the area and without time-consuming offline surveys. A modified Bayesian regression algorithm is introduced to estimate a posterior signal strength probability distribution over all locations based on online observations from WLAN access points (AP) assuming Gaussian prior centered over a logarithmic pass loss mean. To continuously adapt to dynamic changes, Bayesian kernels parameters are continuously updated and optimized genetically based on recent APs observations. The radio map is further optimized by a fast features reduction algorithm to select the most informative APs. Additionally, the system provides reliable integrity monitor (accuracy measure). Two different experiments on IEEE 802.11 networks show that the dynamic radio map provides 2-3m accuracy, which is comparable to results of an up-to-date offline radio map. Also results show the consistency of estimated accuracy measure with actual positioning accuracy.},

@inproceedings{bernardos_real_2010,
	Abstract = {Due to the random characteristics of the indoor propagation channel, received signal strength-based localization systems usually need to be manually calibrated once and again to guarantee their best performance. Calibration processes are costly in terms of time and resources, so they should be eliminated or reduced to a minimum. In this direction, this paper presents an optimization algorithm to automatically calibrate a propagation channel model by using a Least Mean Squares technique: RSS samples gathered in a number of reference points (with known positions) are used by a LMS algorithm to calculate those values for the channel model's constants that minimize the error computed by a hyperbolic triangulation positioning algorithm. Preliminary results on simulated and real data show that the localization error in distance is effectively reduced after a number of training samples. The LMS algorithm's simplicity and its low computational and memory costs make it adequate to be used in real systems.},

@inproceedings{chen_sensor-assisted_2005,
	Abstract = {Wi-Fi based indoor location systems have been shown to be both cost-effective and accurate, since they can attain meter-level positioning accuracy by using existing Wi-Fi infrastructure in the environment. However, two major technical challenges persist for current Wi-Fi based location systems, instability in positioning accuracy due to changing environmental dynamics, and the need for manual offline calibration during site survey. To address these two challenges, three environmental factors (people, doors, and humidity) that can interfere with radio signals and cause positioning inaccuracy are identified. Then, we have proposed a sensor-assisted adaptation method that employs RFID sensors and environment sensors to adapt the location systems automatically to the changing environmental dynamics. The proposed adaptation method performs online calibration to build multiple context-aware radio maps under various environmental conditions. Experiments were performed on the sensor-assisted adaptation method. The experimental results show that the proposed adaptive method can avoid adverse reduction in positioning accuracy under changing environmental dynamics.},

	Abstract = {WLAN RSS-based localization has been a hot research topic for the last years. To obtain high accuracy in the noisy wireless channel, WLAN location determination systems usually use a calibration phase, where a radio map, capturing the signal strength signatures at different locations in the area of interest, is built. The radio map construction process takes a lot of time and effort, reducing the value of WLAN localization systems. In this paper, we propose 3D ray tracing as a way for automatically generating a highly accurate radio map. We compare this method to previously used propagation modeling-based methods like the Wall Attenuation Factor and 2D ray tracing models. We evaluate the performance of each method and its computational cost in a typical residential environment. We also examine the sensitivity of the localization accuracy to inaccurate material parameters. Our results quantify the accuracy- complexity trade-off of the different proposed techniques with 3D ray tracing giving the best localization accuracy compared to measurements with acceptable computational requirements on a typical PC.},

Correlation analysis of the transmitted signal to two receivers gives rise to one hyperbolic function. With more than two receivers, we can compute more hyperbolic functions, which ideally intersect in one unique point. With TDOA measurement uncertainty, we face a non-linear estimation problem. We suggest and compare a Monte Carlo based method for positioning and a gradient search algorithm using a nonlinear least squares framework. The former has the feature of being easily extended to a dynamic framework where a motion model of the transmitter is included. A small simulation study is presented.},

@article{han_localization_2013,
	Abstract = {In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), localization is one of the most important technologies since it plays a critical role in many applications, e.g., target tracking. If the users cannot obtain the accurate location information, the related applications cannot be accomplished. The main idea in most localization methods is that some deployed nodes (landmarks) with known coordinates (e.g., GPS-equipped nodes) transmit beacons with their coordinates in order to help other nodes localize themselves. In general, the main localization algorithms are classified into two categories: range-based and range-free. In this paper, we reclassify the localization algorithms with a new perspective based on the mobility state of landmarks and unknown nodes, and present a detailed analysis of the representative localization algorithms. Moreover, we compare the existing localization algorithms and analyze the future research directions for the localization algorithms in WSNs.},

@article{haque_profiling-based_2013,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the indoor localization problem, i.e., identifying the Cartesian coordinates of an object or a person under the roof. To solve this problem we consider an RF-based localization method called profiling, a two-step process, where a radio map of the monitored area is first constructed by collecting signal strength from known locations. An unknown location is then predicted using this radio map as a reference. In this paper, we first propose a K nearest neighbor (KNN) profiling-based localization method dubbed LEMON (location estimation by mining oversampled neighborhoods). It is based on a low-cost, low-power wireless devices and ensures good accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. We then propose a variant of LEMON called combinatorial localization which exhaustively searches for the best possible set of nearest neighbors. We further define a Bayesian network model for the same localization problem. The performance of these methods is evaluated through extensive experiments in various indoor areas. We found an interesting outcome that the simple KNN-based approach can offer better localization accuracy compared to other complex localization methods. Thus we further enhance the performance of the KNN-based approach using multiple RF channels.},

First, we improve the computational efficiency of the two-dimensional (2D) ray-tracing method by reorganizing the objects in an indoor environment into irregular cells. Second, by making use of the two-dimensional ray-tracing results, a new three-dimensional (3D) propagation-prediction model is developed, which can save 99\% of the computation time of a traditional three-dimensional model. This new hybrid model is more accurate than two-dimensional models, and more efficient in computing the path loss to any point in the building than traditional three-dimensional models. In this model, reflection and refraction by layered materials, and diffraction for the corners of the walls, are considered. A patched-wall model is used to improve the accuracy of prediction in the method. Finally, a comparison between simulation and measurements shows good agreement.},

	Abstract = {Location determination of mobile users within a building is challenging due to the complexities of the indoor radio propagation characteristics. For a RF based indoor system, a common practice is to construct a signal strength map table showing the radio signal strength at different known locations in the building. A mobile user's location at an arbitrary point in the building is then determined by measuring the signal strength at the location in question and determining the location by referring to the above map table using a LMSE (least mean square error) criterion. Much work has been done lately in the indoor radio propagation in order to automatically generate the signal strength map table according to the changing environment. This research is based on the ARIADNE indoor localization system with the purpose to analyze the impact of building structures and indoor furniture on the performance of the indoor localization. We provide a simple strategy to model these indoor structures, and we verify the methodology using a complex basement building. Experimental results indicate that up to 15\% improvement in location estimation is achievable from the proposed method},

This approach relies on comparing a pre-trained database (or radio map) with the received signal strength (RSS) of a mobile device. However, such methods are highly sensitive to environmental dynamics. A number of solutions based on added anchor points have been proposed to overcome this problem. This paper proposes an approach using existing beacons to measure the RSS from other beacons as a reference, which we call inter-beacon measurement, for the calibration of radio maps on the fly. This approach is feasible because most current beacons (such as Wi-Fi and ZigBee stations) have both transmitting and receiving capabilities. This approach would relieve the need for additional anchor points that deal with environmental dynamics. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify our claims.},

@inproceedings{pan_adaptive_2007,
	Abstract = {Accurately locating users in a wireless environment is an important task for many pervasive computing and AI applications, such as activity recognition. In a WiFi environment, a mobile device can be localized using signals received from various transmitters, such as access points (APs). Most localization approaches build a map between the signal space and the physical location space in a offline phase, and then using the received-signal-strength (RSS) map to estimate the location in an online phase. However, the map can be outdated when the signal-strength values change with time due to environmental dynamics. It is infeasible or expensive to repeat data calibration for reconstructing the RSS map. In such a case, it is important to adapt the model learnt in one time period to another time period without too much recalibration. In this paper, we present a location-estimation approach based on Manifold co-Regularization, which is a machine learning technique for building a mapping function between data. We describe LeManCoR, a system for adapting the mapping function between the signal space and physical location space over different time periods based on Manifold Co-Regularization. We show that LeManCoR can effectively transfer the knowledge between two time periods without requiring too much new calibration effort. We illustrate LeMan-CoR's effectiveness in a real 802.11 WiFi environment.},

	Abstract = {A number of techniques for indoor and outdoor WiFi localization using received signal strength (RSS) signatures have been published. Little work has been performed to characterize the RSS signatures used by these WiFi localization techniques or to assess the accuracy of current channel models to represent the signatures. Without accurate characterization and models of the signatures, a large amount of empirical data is needed to evaluate the performance of the WiFi localization techniques. The goal of this paper is to characterize the RSS signatures and present a novel wall breakpoint model for use in WiFi localization simulations to eliminate the need for large empirical databases. In this paper, we present our empirical database of RSS signatures measured in the campus of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, characterize the RSS signatures used in WiFi localization, evaluate the performance of the current WiFi channel model, and propose a novel wall breakpoint model, which exploits site-specific information to provide a tighter fit to the empirical RSS signatures. From the RSS signature characterization, it was observed that the behavior of the RSS signatures is dependant on the location of the Access Point (AP) with a building due to shadow fading. Our proposed model improves upon the simpler WiFi channel model by adding a dynamic site-specific wall breakpoint to account for the location of the AP within a building and allowing for proper simulation of the outdoor path-loss environment.},

	Abstract = {Wireless Indoor localization systems based on RSSI-values typically consist of an offline training phase and online position determination phase. During the offline phase, geo-referenced RSSI measurements, called fingerprints, are recorded to build a radio-map of the building. This radiomap is then searched during the position determination phase to estimate another nodes' location. Usually the radiomap is build manually, either by users pin-pointing their location on a ready-made floorplan or by moving in pre-specified patterns while scanning the network for RSSI values. This cumbersome process leads to inaccuracies in the radiomap. Here, we propose a system to build the floorplan and radio-map simultaneously by employing a handheld laser mapping system in an IEEE802.15.4-compatible network. This makes indoor- and radio-mapping for wireless localization less cumbersome, faster, more reliable and delivers a new way to evaluate wireless localization systems.},

	Abstract = {For planning of indoor wireless LAN systems working in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, the signal propagation prediction is needed. Empirical and semi-empirical models represent an efficient approach as opposed to deterministic models due to its simplicity and superiority in calculation time. For these models, suitable empirical parameters to characterize propagation channel must be provided. In this paper, an in building linear, one-slope (OS) empirical and semi-empirical multi-wall (MW) models are studied. Different types of MW models in the office and classroom like environment have been reported. OS purely account for attenuation of power law equation with distance while MW with additional attenuation due to obstacles such as wall, partition etc. The results and accuracy of those models are compared and discussed. The developed optimal indoor OS, MWC and MWE is then tuned to slope and MW model available in wireless simulation tool namely ICS Telecom},

	Abstract = {Indoor wireless systems will be used in a large variety of office, factory and residential environments. Thus, adequate guidelines for radio port placement are needed to ensure satisfactory performance at the lowest cost. These guidelines must be derived from a large body of site-specific propagation data. However, collecting a statistically significant database through measurements is a daunting task. Alternatively, this database can be generated by using propagation models, validated by measurements. Several models exist for the statistical characterization of microwave propagation within buildings, However, statistical models do not provide site-specific information. We propose a hybrid model in which ray tracing is used to predict, at any given location, the local mean of the received power and the delay profile. Variations about the mean values can then be captured via a statistical description matched to the local environment. We describe an efficient 3-D ray tracing algorithm which accounts for all (transmitted as well as reflected) rays reaching the receiver location after an arbitrary number of reflections. We include the effects of the angle of incidence, the material dielectric constant and the antenna patterns. The predicted values for the local means of the received power are then compared against measurements to establish the accuracy of this approach},

@article{yin_learning_2008,
	Abstract = {In wireless networks, a client's locations can be estimated using the signals received from various signal transmitters. Static fingerprint-based techniques are commonly used for location estimation, in which a radio map is built by calibrating signal-strength values in the offline phase. These values, compiled into deterministic or probabilistic models, are used for online localization. However, the radio map can be outdated when the signal-strength values change with time due to environmental dynamics, and repeated data calibration is infeasible or expensive. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, known as LEMT (Location Estimation using Model Trees), to reconstruct a radio map using real-time signal- strength readings received at the reference points. This algorithm can take into account real-time signal-strength values at each time point and make use of the dependency between the estimated locations and reference points. We show that this technique can effectively accommodate the variations of signal strength over different time periods without the need to rebuild the radio maps repeatedly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique on realistic data sets collected from an 802.11b wireless network and a RFID-based network.},
